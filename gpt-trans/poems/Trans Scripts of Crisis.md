notes on writing love poems as he sleeps as TV flickers;
notes on the the vivid blue static illuminating us;
notes on our cuddles; specifically their defiant miracle; as news anchors plunge after
our bodies, buoyed around one another


notes on writing love poems as TV re-enacts America drowning itself;
Too Hot to wash out my spirit clean without burning
TV on mute now, forgive me when the latest hit stays imprinted in my mouth as I kiss you


notes on writing a love poem while tv announces
we are underneath an abortion canopy;
him and I pregnant 
with a queer future there is no language for yet;


You sleep- I  wrap you - persist
To defend this love 
You - beautiful
Beautiful as in trans
Trans as in the universe 
The universe as in impossible to represent in its multi-dimensions


TV asleep now
Outside of the flat screen,  there is a  cat meow, our uncensored bodies, unwaxed rainbows, unshaved forests, my body on this couch - feeding, yours in an arc
I witness
the anchor sinking into my back/ they make breaking of our muse


notes on writing as deep as the misrepresentation; as the world burns, (slowly, then quickly), we write back; notes on what happened when we listened to a poet for a night; notes on what happened when we believed that metaphors were indeed true; that magic was in fact on purpose; that we were in fact gods, believers, cryptic queers, mystics, magicians, delivered unbruised cosmos’ love letters 
the definitions of love TV refuses to play;




the songs that were censored
the language that was stolen and yet
heaven still willed its way into earth


notes on reveling beyond the interference;


notes on when I too spit out the script they’ve given me;
notes when the cast of me is desperate to reenact its role;
notes when I believe I am channeling but instead I become their channel
notes on piercing the poem out of the frequency anyways;
notes on recognizing my shadow among the projection;


& perhaps our dreams and the ocean floor
Remain the only unsurveilled part of us left
So dare you my love dream as fluid as possible and then
I will meet you on a patio, dance in the underbellies of warehouses, make love in closets - and
Despite the static
I will find you where no part of us will be on record;


as Instagram outscrolls me, as violence trends,  with you I pray to
The blessing and punishment of the water
And I pray that
The trans scripts of crisis we inherit
release us
Until your body and mine
Are only on this couch
&
And our dreams are the deep blue unseen
