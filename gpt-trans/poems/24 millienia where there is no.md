24 hours in which you touch me and my hands do not shake
24 hours where the erotic of me is sacred and safe
24 hour where there is no 


24 hours where women femme and transmen and themes walk on the street enveloped by the protection of the liquid night 


let myself be raw I let myself be broken I let myself be hated by the god damn ocean I let my self bloom like an ancient reverence I let myself break open every ancient sentence


24 hours where I feel in your rawest awe
24 hours where you and I touch each other
make our beds
weep our bodies 
wring ourselves out like towels
empty & 
humid & shiny      
                  spilling open what we thought we would become
we water ourselves into birds
old growth towards a world
where there is no rape
where
we
open up blisters of deadnames into
after life knowing
our reaping was always heavier than heaven?
that our arson is only an attack of kindness? 
that our only guilt is how we survived
so willingly?


24 weeks where there is no giving and giving endless heeps to godless men boys that will be boys that will be blood 
24 weeks where i release every ancient anchor and we drain the tub swim swallow spit i expel every ancient anchor i undrown it no more gripping twisting gasping water too salty drowning too heavy to say no 
I expel


24 weeks where I absolve myself until there is not salt, I swim in the pacific
I deboard the survivorship, and run on the land free, holding you, our hands covered in pearls,
The grains of sand in my neck tick down back to before my mother was bankrupt of her motherland 


Every man come out of us   shivering


24 weeks in which I  reverse every timeline 
back to before we swallowed our queerest colour


Back to before you sugar spooned my mouth and I felt I was on the cusp of danger
a orange clockwork of orgasms one day and a TNT can unscrewed the next


I take back  bechipazon running backwards - how my ancestors first moved - running, their belts fastened, their walking stick in their hand, eating it hurriedly
I take 
back all of our bodies
to heaven 


From the ribs that


spilled 
of millipede that migrated into our sex and our secular




Until I am no longer in union of sovetsky centuries of fear
 wailing back to the ocean
I rage back to the belly of the whale
I rebirth myself in your arms, even if I spasm in my sleep, 
Even if I am donbass where God abandoned us, I give myself a seat and then a sound at the table I face what has been most painful I will not self erase I am not erasable 
I  tie my hair back to the first brush stroke before they painted me in the color of war, in front of you, before they pretend that the violence of borders of states and the violence of borders of gender do not create each other 
but
I wash out this deathless state, I unshave my legs,
I unthread the husband stitched bible and I call forth the queers and the Jews they made illegal, the magic they made illegal, I break the contracts of violence against Otkaznik, Refusenik, Ruski-Ukrainsky, Evreisky, Kvir, Transgender, geneshinu, devushki, Kin, 


24 years  in which I  rebirth my babishka self,
A boy within the mud of a woman
My gender built from 
clay and 
blood and 
sparkly rocks 
from the Future I do it for 
24 centuries for
Every Woman who was not allowed to read from the Torah to be 
Given the grace of language
Angels ask for me to hand out my poems, not as  weapons, and I no longer end up empty handed
I learn how to pronounce my Original Self
June Jordan said let this poetry be an exorcism
Audre Lorder said my silence will not protect me
Abracadabra is Hebrew for I create as I speak
So I name the 
The Talmud of Transness
Zachar
Nekevah
Adrogynos
Tumtum
Ay’lonit
Saris




24 millenia of 
So let me break the reality through blaring out my blessings
The male womb healers
the homoerotic love of David and Jonathan
Shekina
For 24 millenia of  Heavenly queer bodies, children naming themselves, stars splitting their chromosomes open
On El Milvado - a sound so broken it is whole
Celestial genderqueer deities
The birthright to dream so much deeper than safety
