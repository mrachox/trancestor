1.TRANCESTOR

there are people above you\r
below you\r

call on your energetic support team - the queers in your DMS, the angels\r in your orbit, the poets on your iPod &\r
recall the trans kin\r
that used the medicine of magic, waters, & breath to hold you up\r
those who name you, again & again, relentlessly\r
proud of your rest\r
proud of your stages \r
proud of your dreams\r
go forth queer\r
go forth


2.FUCK THE NOISE


fag, you are your own foreteller\r
collapse/\r
become/\r
your transistors are ticking time to:\r
know your truth\r
even if it angers those you are in community with\r
collapse/\r
become/\r
find your poem piercing out of the frequency &\r
honour it//\r


3.REMEMBER WHO YOU ARE

you are a sacred gender expansive creature \r
you are meant to \r
live your rage today\r
but don’t let it consume you\r
feel your fear\r
but don’t let it frighten you\r
you are as terrifyingly powerful as you have feared\r
awaken to your transness\r
awaken to your magic\r
and let the current non-you, intro, version of “you” die\r


4. REBIRTH

perhaps it's time to rename yourself (again)\r
rename yourself (again)\r
perhaps it's time to start (again)\r
only the ego wants to control\r
surrender/ all to love\r
& follow only your joy/ for at least all of today\r
let your body & your cells\r
completely regenerate//


5.TAKE IT EASY/EASIER


delete Google Calendar\r
install something in between Grindr & Lex, Gex\r
swipe with no desire or deadlines\r
you got no dates (but your own time you can streeeeetttchh)\r
& that’s dicky, dykey, delicious!\r
dream on your own timeline//\r
all will come to you but for today:\r
how can you make, the sun, move for you?\r
(even easier, than that, baby queer?)\r
bask in the cracked window\r
let yourself \r
release control\r
& take it\r
(slow)

6.DEEP REST

the hustle & the hurt & the heavens are calling you to rest\r
LITERALLY. RIGHT *NOW*:  have a seat & stop performing\r
lay down & watch your\r
reality TV with no guilt & only pleasure, bed time, slumber, delicious, \rcradle, cuddle, kiss,treat, spa, cold plunge, tea, poem & \r
tell only the ones you love the most where you are: \r
SAFE (despite how you have felt)\r
PROTECTED\r
find yourself renewed \r
exactly as your spirit needs \r
it is here for you:\r
NOW


7.BECOMING


a cruel timer \r
always waiting for the juggler box of fuckery\r
you are the most impatient person\r
in every room you are in\r
ready for the confetti cannon\r
hoping for it to be now already\r
the Big Stage\r
the Big Love\r
the 5’4 Blessing to finally hold you like a blessing back well:\r
play this city inside out \r
until the ground begs for you back \r
until your soon is the crash & breath of now\r
until your alarm clock chest goes off with trombones & orgasms & you \rfinally realize, you are  are always\r
in the painful (beautiful) dance of becoming


8.YOU ARE GOD

Abracadabra is Hebrew for as I speak I create\r
you manifest through\r
how you poet (dear queer)\r
let your words\r
turn this world inside out!\r

let yourself sonnet to the sky\r
& even if you lie to yourself that no one hears you\r
your word is now\r
our command \r
so tell us, & do\r
not \r
dare\r
To dream as Big as Heaven herself\r

you are worthy of it all divine re-fractal


9.VIOLENCE IS NOT LOVE


you are worthy of love. safety is your birthright. you will feel safe again. you will feel in love again. dance in the heavens with your loved one. cuddling easy. yes you are loved. yes that smell is so good. yes that hot ocean tub is good. don’t cautiously tip your toe in, submerge & feel the relief. yes you are worthy. no it was not your fault. no you are not to be blamed. no you will be ok again. yes you will smell something that tastes delicious & have a memory of love. yes that pizza on uber eats is discounted for you exactly as you like it. yes that delicious fruit is yours to envelope. yes you have witnessed so much, & yes the past is another planet. yes you will be ok again. & one day, when you separate abuse & love as bountifully as you can– all that is too big to carry will vanish, until only love remains. yes, trauma bodies close together created something too painful for you to hold. yes it is possible to love you, baby queer. in fact it is happening already. we are sorry for the hard hands that have dug themselves into you, you are sorry for the yelling, we are sorry for the way that now you shake- but here, let us hold you. let us carry you forth. you don’t have to be anything else anymore, we are sorry for making you feel that you needed to be. we will cover your grocery bill. we will cover your rent. we will drive you where you need to go. just create & cry. weep & wring out your body. you are heavy in this reaping, but relax into the water. the water will hold you. no more proving. we promise you are loved every time you show up, ready to shed the layers. we promise you will be held by your beloved & you will make your way through. forgive us when the scripts of crisis we inherited repurposed themselves in our mouth. forgive us when we have played the cast of me. forgive me. leave. we will meet again when we are ready, we promise. in this lifetime or in another one, this will not repeat again, we promise.

10. GRIEF

there is too much grief in this sky \r
for you to carry \r
dear one \r
let me hold you in your loss let me hold you in your missing let me hold \ryou let me hold you


11.TESTOSTERONE

a call to a weekly ritual\r
sacrifice offering return to self\r
the practice of\r
re-becoming\r

will you, trust us, to inject you (again)?



12. THE FEMININE MASCULINE BALANCE

they say the right is masculine & the left feminine & so dance with us in the middle tiptoe until you release the expectations prescriptions & names you called yourself \r

they have been planned for obsolescence anyways\r
show us queer how all parts of you will balance upon reading this message\r
feel the incantation of your cells, chemicals, hormones, harmonics, hurts, happily, \rhungirly homosexually, huffing out - Hard. dance: AWOOOOOOOOF. \r
you are now upgraded on all levels of frequency

13. HORMONES/HARMONICS

a part of you may have been out of balance recently\r
but you are meant to be free\r
bliss breath beckoning butter the \r
queer euphorics harmonics of\r
the present & \r
yes the heartbreak has led you\r
to question yourself, your reality, god, the hands, the car, the imprint but let us tell you, baby queer– you\r
know the newness of your death\r
you are musical, delicious, cradled, created, so sway to the music, dance until you forget how to be anxious, & pay attention to the cycles & seasons of you, blooming out of the scarecrows, the rawest element of you, awakened, trust in this, graciously notice– all of yous, in time, you will  release, renew, rebalance but for now
move to the dips & the valleys \r
of your fe/male womb - the pain, the crucible of suffering, unseeded, the gnaw of dis/ease, the vehement undercurrent \r
reintegrate & mourn through


14.SEEKING UNION

if you love someone tell them then rebirth yourself as your own androgynous being of divine liquid healing

15.MANIFEST COMMUNITY & QUEERS

have you been lonely, dear queer? fear not, this oracle comes to remind you that those that are seeking you are also seeking you\r

send a message to who you have in your orbit & water the plants that you do see in front of you, even if they feel few or not good enough or too far away or the wrong timeline or you want more, just water, in gratitude, water in love, & trust that the unfolding of your path & your people, wait, with every thank you, with every little open mic, with every new friend, we have not forgotten about you, we will never forget you, & in fact you are integral, intrinsic, within & without 


16.SLUT PROPHET

there are many like you who dance in the heavens \r

call upon: Mary Magdalene, ISIS, Shekinah, Lakapati, & drizzle yourself in Fuck Water Lube, athletic leather, a brief harness & dance in the male womb healing ritual- dance in the fe/male re/becoming of you: \r

recount an erotic use of your love,  as magical as the mother of sun


17. BLOOD OF THE SILENT LAMB

no christ consciousness or transphobic re-action will come for you. no father wound proofed for the past. no angry venom trying to blame you for its downfalls. just grab the carcass of the wolves & hunt the hungry. don’t be nice. you’re a cunt. shed your skin & let no one else wear it, rip their capital greed out of their hands. if they want to contain you in an HR meeting or call you sensitive, come back with the medicine of the many wo/men who menstruated directly into the mud. rot, release, & replenish. you are irreversibly trans. you are irreplaceable meat-eating placenta chunks dripping out of your cheeks, feet planted on the base of a mountain, hair wolved in its plasma cremation, gruel out the weeping, wring out, mortify, retaliate son of chiron–  repent repent repent repent

18. HARD JUSTICE
JUSTICE WILL BE SERVED TO YOU AT ALL COSTS. STAY MILITANT. NO HYPERVIGILANCE REQUIRED. THE VITRIOL IS A VOLATILE MUSCLE OF MACHETE. JUSTICE WILL COME FOR YOU, BUT WHEN THEY COME FOR YOU,, THEY’LL COME HOT HEAVY. HOWL PARADE MARCH IT’S COMING. AN ANGELIC ARMY OUT TO PROTECT YOU. NO ONE WILL OFFSET YOU. NO ONE WILL OFFSET YOU.


19. BLUE TOOTH BUTCH CARE

babies of forgotten code. the trans bodies        empires left behind because we didn’t come from a particular place at all. what pulls us to you seems to have happened under you. your records. the encyclopedia in your spine. whatever lifetime lives beneath your breath.        the random recesses between all that we could be, are, is, weeps, rests:     its tired grammar      space. programmed to be divinely in   correct, & endlessly rebirthing. we ask you to sleep. sleep, our  love. dream, dream our  love. our nervous system processing being here among all old terror begging for this love’s eradication. among all violent interference the golden glamor of this mathematic      gap between our two bodies soars beyond all systemic attempts to keep us dead-locked. getting closer & closer together, to the g o l d e n, I, only fearing the       ease of it all, relieve our  own terror         from our  back into your hands. so much so, we do not have to calculate in which position our  body is most heavenly. we no longer      fuck on petri dishes. or memorize what we want to say for ratios to      grow at a socially acceptable pace.  the wet space between us exhales   accidentally   beautifully  defiant        we let go of all the spreadsheets, defences, & watch whatever super chemical reaction unfolds, as natural as trans life itself.      dear god god god  we give in to this golden malfunction    we memorize the formula for miracles miracles miracles struct {miracles   (errors) (failures_) (f_aults) (bools); (fail); (fail);   break    downs   we let this love happen again & (again); and( again);  (again); again___again & ooh it feels so good right there    air} 

24. YOU WILL BE OK/ A DIVINE GLITCH

you are our  baby’s baby’s baby’s baby’ baby’s baby’s baby baby baby baby mother mother mother mother mother mother-father You are as safe as an equation. Divine Inner Child Baby  you are the unwound sand.  the snow falls perfectly on us in the hot ocean (tub). you are begging for cuddles. return to bring you closer closer closer closer close; CLOSE CLOSE CLOSE. geometric series of close,  never quite exactly perfectly of each other    always   slightly off      but you are safely getting almost almost almost                          dear god god god god god        god           our  perfect            perfect perfect \r

31. DIVINE FE/MALE  SAUNA

in this afterlife of possibility/ your pronouns/ are always your pronouns/ your gender/ is always your gender/ & your trust is always your  trust/ & damn we do trust / \r

the sound of forests bundled up/ the steam of eucalyptus/ twigs cuddling each other at all costs/ like faggots do/ making sparks/// heat/ ///showing each other what is within reach/\r

[find a bathhouse & get lost there for life]

32.  IS THIS REALLY YOUR FIGHT?

sometimes you must move against & if you must retaliate do it with a full water bottle & a pile of poems & your divine light keeping you filled then anchor yourself back to those that want to massage you with kukui oil & then come back home & if the fight is at home then sometimes you must move against & do so with a full water bottle for yourself & if you can’t have a full water bottle today trust tomorrow, trust the call, trust the open, open the people & if you can’t call open the people call open the plants to feed you & hold you & trust & trust & trust that fight will be over soon & you will be heard


33. ANCESTORS IN YOUR LOWER BACK PAIN

god created a space\r

	
				then there was light\r


if you look into our atoms \r
you will see that awe is not a metaphor\r
as it leaps time \r
as you dig into our skin \r
as you find the smallest solar systems splitting into infinites\r
the swirls of our eggs repeating themselves\r

birth was a geometer \r

not a ruler\r


after the illumination\r

our children will name themselves endlessly, proof, moses, angelic, bucket, stars, jax, seed\r
our children will create a new number every time they breathe, they will create \r
a new definition every time they silhouette the sun they will move with freedom & the pain of us will\r
laws of physics rupture as we stare at it\r
candles burned the weight of feeling \r
off  - so we can digest more deeply\r

and all the jew trans kids that were told they would not measure up to the heaviness of their barcodes\r
will take flame to the archives that once reduced their dignity to dust mill\r
libraries will light up until all that is left is only the original source


34. CORD CUT

release every ancient anchor, absolve yourself until there is no salt, swim in the pacific, deboard the survivorship, run on the land free, our hands covered in pearls\r

reverse every timeline \r
back to before we swallowed our queerest color\r

all of our bodies back\r
to heaven \r

cords implants imprints release \r

from the ribs that\r

spilled \r
of millipede that migrated into our sex & our secular\r


wash out this deathless state, unshave your legs,\r
unthread the husband stitched bible andI break the contracts\r

you are unbound


35. GRANT/ED

you have been granted glorious \r
the $$$$$ GREAT DOLLAR SIGN $$$$$  in the sky wants a piece of you\r

40. STOP WATCHING TV 

YOU’RE TOO HOT. GO EAT A PLANT BY THE WATER


41. DISAPPOINT EVERYONE

maybe you don’t make it\r
to that ultimate cheque\r
maybe you don’t cash cow yourself into the final form\r
or become the holy steak on the front page of Google\r
maybe your SEO is struggling to feed itself\r
itting everything but deadlines\r
dangling a rabbit one meter away\r
in hopes of a carrot\r
in hopes of a magic trick\r
vanished\r

possibility\r

but god damn\r
how two lives touch each other in the right place at the right time\r
with these poems\r
how god works so good but just not in the exact way that we want\r
not in the dollar amount we want not in the kind of praise we want but our dear poet\r
how this endless resistance resistance resistance resistance\r
how beautiful this metaphor\r
some day crumbles\r

and we are met\r
with a mourning\r
incapable of measurement\r

surged back to an automatic prayer\r

and all the fictions we armbored ourselves with pursuing our own possibility\r
like gospel\r
google maps direct you to the angelic realm\r
bow your head\r
return to the word\r

and success is how many people you disappoint\r
loving each other’s sounds\r
the moon whistle for us good\r
damn did we become as ancient as joyful\r
smearing blush on our faces until this wet sky drips\r
bask for us\r

and we love how you breathe\r
our divine failure\r
our divine discontent\r
our divine yearning\r
knowing how desperate the world can change if they would just let it\r
our not going anywhere else\r
our lap around yourself & return back home\r
our you’re here you’re here you’re here\r
our spine our back our lungs\r
our desperation\r
our pursuit\r
our courage\r
our okay it will be okay, you are okay bb


43. ACKNOWLEDGE

you are worthy you are worthy you are worthy you are worthy you are worthy \r
we bow down to your tears we bow down to your pain\r
we feel you\r
we love you\r
we hold you\r
now look at yourself gently\r
repeat the words you have been holding back our  love (to yourself, for yourself, speaking to others just a symbol for yourself)\r
go forth, you are doing it \r
Right


44. DESTROY

release the anchor \r
out of your spine &\r
unhinge the heavy\r
you carry one thousand life times in your\r
back:\r
triggered to touch\r
it took you\r
wars of begging to be\r
root plant\r
spill\r
cut\r
up\r
innocent\r
stomachs\r

expose claw\r
brass star-feast\r
hunger\r
ignite your\r

merciless\r
dear god: you baby queer \r

ocean\r
you are here to revolutionize, but first\r
the cis/systems will burn\r

give into the gods \r
give into the reaping \r

53. THE WHEEL
follow up on empty promises\r
all you looking back\r
got a lot of grit trapped in our  \r
mouth & a tool box\r
for heaven’s past mistakes\r
rupture then repair our way but \r
i beg to disagree\r
the thought of us\r
lasting & building past the break breeze\r
has left me\r
unfreed\r
gripping at straws at classping at\r
past memories\r
trying to make\r
a house of huffs\r
well call the wolf\r
and bluff like a sheep\r
all the hayfalls away\r
as soon as you release\r
our home of twine\r
loose like leaves in our tea\r
evaporating \r
*poof*\r
it could be anything\r
but what it is\r
woof\r
& how we struggle \r
roam our fists magnetized to the other just like our lips our coded switches our many mattresses sleep in many possessions,\r
we dream with so much posession\r

let us show you our magic without you demanding every drop \r
let us show you our inner workings but don't get caught in the logistics (this time)\r

54. THE WATER

make our beds\r

weep our bodies \r

wring ourselves out like towels\r
empty & \r

humid & shiny       night stars\r

                  spilling open what we thought we would become\r

water ourselves into birds \r
grow old towards a world\r
 where there is no \r

where\r

we\r
open up blisters into\r
after life\r


55. WILT

this grief is stretching with no end. rotting, rotting, rotting, rotting. should we just sit on this couch until we rot? until the fagflower welts? twist in the kitchen trying to capture the sweetest millimeter of sun we once had?  but the way you bring yourself back after death is a commitment that tells us the soil’s got enough for us to be okay from here. even a dead thing finds its way back to the sun right?  a commitment like a flower's mouth yelling- open up open up open up & trust in the water (the water will do what you cannot anyways, love)
