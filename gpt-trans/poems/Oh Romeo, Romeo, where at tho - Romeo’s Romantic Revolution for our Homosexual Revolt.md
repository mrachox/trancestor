Oh Romeo, Romeo, where at tho - Romeo’s Romantic Revolution for our Homosexual Revolt? ##Romeo
Oh Romeo, Romeo, where at tho the poetics of ophelia feeling me?  I’ll ##abandon thy father name call me Angelicunt** and cannonize my literature. Oh Romeo Romeo, where at tho the  real queers, who faced their worst fears, and deep freaks with their dark dreams in your English Classroom? Oh Romeo, where at tho the crypstic mystics, and the magicians, the poets and priests that listen, the witches and the switches,  no more yearning for relief in death, this is romance returned and rewarded, the moon is envious of how I speak to manifest, oh Romeo, Romeo, return the poems that were subject to theft.  I write for the believers who never stopped, the killers of the killer cops, I write for the the me too amount to, the hunters of witch hunters, a trues loves kiss in the hottest trans summer, oh Romeo Romeo show me poems of the raw life, show me poems of the jaw line, show me poems of the systems breaking down, us breaking open entirely, and the  light, through which the yonder breaks shatters the ceiling of  glass - complete poetic justice
