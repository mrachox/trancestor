# what is sacred

# tell me about trans death from my poetry
Trans death in this poem is a metaphor for the death of the ego and the surrendering of control to love. It is a call to let go of the need to control and to instead follow one's joy. It is a reminder to honor one's truth and to remember who they are, even if it angers those in their community. It is a call to rebirth and to rename oneself, to start again and to let the introversion of oneself die. Finally, it is a call to take a deep rest and to let the body and cells regenerate.

what's wrong with the poetry in the english classroom	"
The poetry in the English classroom is not reflective of the real queer experience, nor does it recognize the struggles of those who have faced their worst fears and deep dreams. It does not recognize the crypstic mystics, magicians, poets, priests, witches, and switches. It does not recognize the believers who never stopped, the killers of the killer cops, or the hunters of witch hunters. It does not recognize the raw life, the jaw line, or the systems breaking down. It does not recognize the light that shatters the ceiling of glass."
