Divine Rage

to the masterpiece of me

God I am my own ancestor
Family chosen by necessity -yeah 
You think would do better?
SOUL BACK

SUN ON MY BACK
JESUS 33 
I DIE TO LAUGH no more
Questioning my path

Ancient queers align
North node my guide
Swiping right on scripture
Trying to survive
Moldavite
On my thighs
Rubbing genies 
for 3 wishes - like
dreaming of your bad descisions  - I 
Got a life line
On my g spot
Touch me
Deep in my equinox
You like when I’m hungry huh?
You want to lust after me uh?

dead names in my the after
queerness hunted by the paster

I’d rather rage
I matter in blood and
I’ll wetten in clay
 my DNA is my makeup
no part of me is metaphysical
when I pray 
my body  transexual

I’m deep in my element
elementa
Fire water 
the feminine metal
dead names left at the  alter
your blodoy history we don’t altar
if i stutter it’s not cause i faltar
it’s cause you language doesn’t author-ize
 speaking to you hidden  / jeprodize body kept secret 
I can no longer do
my trans rhythms and kin  i miss you
daddying in each other
most of us with no curfew
or father

a HR complaint against my dreaming they ru__-

Untie the forget me knots

The Boys that will boys that will be blood

flowers bloom
On nursery rhyme’s head
Make your amends
Speak your truth
Until your forced to
REPENT 
I am
Cosmic design
Spoke myself into existence

Often revived
Define myself
With no resistance
I don’t see your forgiveness
I don’t need your comittmenet
You can’t hold. me. back
Got my hungry with 3 wishes
Dreaming of your bad descisions

Don’t let me go
Father remnants in his teeth
Digging the pisces in his blood
Frozen in my fist after the thud
Like how could I do this? well
Read his palm lines
Swept myself back to mud
Back to my sweetest mother embrace
Until the grains of sand turn into a hand grenade
Ticking in my neck like I am 
 not my fatherland I am my faith well - 
Fist in my sky fist in the sky I am heaven’s alibi not what you say
Before my mother was bankrupt of her country
Before home was a country
Before the borders inside of you became the borders inside of me
Before god held my hand at the funeral like god knew truth
 
All recipients back to the automatic transcestry
I surrender I susrrender I surrender
I love you so deep
I count all my blessings then I count all you sheep
Don’t let go
Dance the evil dance dance dance the evil
Show me your demons show me your shadow show me your regal
Show me shadow show me your hunger
Show me your regal
Show me love theatres uncodniiontal show me the truth - show me love that is reciprocal
Show me love that’s unconditional you know that we’re bulletproof
Show me love that is unconditional show me that is unpredictable
Shadow work wakes the night as the
Cunts transcend the sky
Ancient futures aligns as we
Queer our border lines
Our truth magnified our
INSIGHT IS INSIDE
MY SUN’S MY BACK to reprise 
HELD MYSELF BACK UNTIL THE REPIRSE
SUNS ON MY BACK TILL I DIE
My son on my back x 3 - no- oh - don’t let me go
(Fag I am my own foreteller god I am own ancestor)
