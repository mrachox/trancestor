Damn damn damn
I dream of kissing the face of mud without the fear of contamination
I got a vengeful kind of beauty have you sent god my location
I'm ready to fist fight with the angels in the sky
Cool my breath off until I fly airless- 
How did I become so reckless?
Peace of find I finally found - dear god where are you at - elapse - I’m in the present of an unprofiled
Heavenly body [staring me] I got a late thotty
Dreaming of slow machine - lets get slottty
Casino a promise of a golden ticket an instagram grid
A life coach hid it
God is a vending machine to some of you bitches 
your spirit manifest your dreams
Capitalism kills it
We got as much hope as we are holy
Filled with holes with my own single story
Defense renamed 
A garden of shame
A profit for a prophet
A body two faced
Two cards one mouth 
Endless 
A snake sheds its skin and
Optimist left imperfect vision again and again
Given given and given endless heaps to
godless men
Boys that will be blood
I release every ancient anchor
And then I drain tub
Swim swallow spit
Preaching a vision
I expel in it
I uncrown until I am effortless
I uncdown until I am above all this
Got myself lost
In some loop with some ruthlessness
Found myself
Chewing on fruit loops - who would choose 
Swallowing cheers perfume - thinking of Lucy lu dancing Lucifer in my bedroom solitude why would I bloom this
As carbon as silicon as inorganic as make believe
My own friends like my silhouette  - they don’t even like me
Ig to myself
iPhone of Delphi remorse code dash and dot 
We document ourselves
Until we rot
An archive gets funded
Before our life
Time gets fought for
Make it through the war
To make it through the night
I become so distorted
The visions outrun me
Throw words at their walls - now the words they become me
A vision of a dream
Lucid make believe
They call me outpace myself
Myself - bitch I am the relief.
My gender is jewish. my god is music. truth is I am translucent.     
A queer blueprint, m ancestors drew it, DNA fluid, trauma I undo it
My skin you could see through it - my garden of semen you could deep bloom it
Zion is above me, my mother she loves me but
I’ve been praying to god like somebody hug me
Staring at strangers hoping for them to name me
Pronouns betray me 
Angels they blame me but
People like my poem but do they pray for me
I feel so alone it’s like I can’t say anything
Shadows possessed me my demons undressed me
My love unrests until I am a naked amphetamine 
Swallowing blisters trying to follow my bliss
Comparing myself to a false metric
They called my magic fictitious, they can’t see what my vision is
Got an army of angels out to protect me
Everything else can just forget me
Forget and forgiven
Forgiven and enabled 
A vision unstable
Lie cheat I’m a fable
Got a seat at the table
I’m ready to face
What has been most painful
I will not self erase
Even if I’m 
Donbass where God Abandoned us
Your flag waived you of your accountability
I saw through the fratricide at the age of 3
Discourse is hopeless
The rhetoric on instagrid
I’m a scorched earth refusenik
Our souls are golden and poetry is   bliss
We’re  bigger than Vancouver
We got god in my uber, and they just
crowned another abuser
I’m tired of it
Looking toward an ancient future
I think I’m above all this
Let me return all self hate 
To the bottom of page
All this shame from the bottom of rib cage
Let me show you how I really am so terrified
Angels hunting me deep in my divine
Hold my lips and ill hold your spine
Swim with me into the sky
Fist to shatter the ceiling
All we got we is our prayers
All we have is our believing 
Stuck in survival
Daydreaming
For it to just gets safer
I write on the queerest of paper
I release it like a flame
Rainbow magic
Awaits
Into the night 
We rage
