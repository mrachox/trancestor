jwalking in the night sky
city wide lights
and coins in my eyes
got hunger in my spirit
I am armed with forgiveness
my family has been
imperfect
I am but a witness
follow up on empty promises
all you looking back
got a lot of grit trapped in my 
mouth and a tool box
for heaven’s past mistakes
rupture then repair my way but 
i beg to disagree
the thought of us
lasting and building past the break breeze
has left me
unfreed
gripping at straws at classping at
past memories
trying to make
a house of huffs
well calll the wolf
and bluff like a sheep
all the hay falls away
as soon as you release
our home of twine
loose like leaves in my tea
evaporating 
poof
it could be anything
but what it is
woof
and how you and i we struggle 
and roam our fists magnetized to the other just like our lips our coded switches our many mattresses sleep in many possessions my love let me show you my magic without you demanding every drop let me show you my inner workings but don't get caught in the logistics cause u got divine will in my budget and faith in my spreadsheet and 
a dame in my tarot spread 
and know
i'm in a small town in rome
while
my heart is left at home
twisted in knots
and i think of you
and god damn
they say 
radical presence
god damn they say
you will regret this
god damn they say
take it for a spin
i was losing steam and then i lost my 
time and time again
so to speak
an endless
dream
a retaliation
now
incomplete
i bang’d on my oppressor now that language is obsolete
aren’t we on the same team
why are we fighting each other
aren’t we on the same team
why are we fighting each other
bittersweet is it
to love beyond tasteless lips
to be sworn of my own solitude
to be reckoned with 
a loose leaf pacifist
when inside of my my spirit
hisses with an army
an angelic army
out to protect
the poets and the priest out to ascend me
the vitriol a volatile muscle of machete
they come for you they come and heavy
baby 
just you and me against the world it seems lately
you spoke to me and now
here
we
 are destined
to be apart
