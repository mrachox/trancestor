When I say family is chosen
I don’t mean it metaphorically
When I say god is trans
I mean it historically
When I say I got demands
I mean it enormously
When I say I like your hands
I mean like hold me
Property lines assembly lines
Owning houses and girls grow up inside
A fathers fist
No one can disown someone they never owned
No one can disown someone that never existed for them
An army of wounded children try to fly to space again, trade you a protest for a revolution, they trade me in for their institution
The spiritual too hot us above stolen life here we are pointing fingers in this grave, hoping to get the best grade, this grave turned into a gun fight
Those that don’t care sit on the sidelines
The home my parents are from doesn’t exist
And I’m not even sure that that home was theirs while they were in it
Look at you sitting on your high horse playing god like you’ve done this before
Point your fingers point your guns point your trigger you point your son
the state will not pay reparations to our souls
Okay we’re here tho let’s get the fuck on with this tug- of war- okay Be less spiteful tho
 this space race we’ve seen before
Leave the fear to the news
Leave the division for the politicians
Memes for the m16s, I dream I’m Schindler’s revision, sometimes its lonely to be the one with the vision
They want you to Upload your spirit to their hard drive
They Gerrymander you like poverty lines
Barcoded your tattoo, give you a number for your spine
Your smile doesn’t cut it I can’t listen to you lie
To all the people that it hurts to choose a bathroom stall to all the people that it hurts to make a call to your motherland
Nothing breaks my heart more than seeing my
Trans fam get denied
Bureaucratic legal identity 
bitch our spirit has always been heavenly
Our spirt has always been renamed infinitely  
All these posts against sexual violence like I haven’t seen your face knee deep in compliance with the state
Talking all that mouth bitch, talking all that fake, just come out and join it’s getting too late bitch
What the fuck are we doing performing for each other?
Let’s Get the fuck out here and let’s go hug you own mothers
My condolences
