iPhone of Delphi 
The ghost of my future
Searching; signs that my relationship is healthy, googling;  signs of karmic codependency 
Consuming; Instagram therapists, 555 hz YouTube, online tarot readings, I buy incense on Amazon, I attend a virtual cacao ceremony for $287 , 
God are you there? Behind the screen? Praying on my phone, paying on my phone
Google: What do I need to repent for?r
AI: What do I need to forgive?
The AI cannot tell me how to forget
Scrolling
the light shining on my face
I pray 
For the algorithm 
To show me
What I refuse to 
Know

I look through my old search history: what does it mean that my rage is so terrified when you threaten to leave?
    hung like crossfire;

in 2032 metaverse real estate is only abandoned virtual homes; decade-old milk in the fridge unspoiled; pristine flowers freshly cut 10 years ago, family photos hang on kitchen walls like dead things;  a chance at a dream materially elapses; make belief worth millions of crypto dollars; an American fantasy; as ready to resurrect upon command; shift;


POST INTERNET 3000; the world wide cords under the ocean have been cut;
u & I my love are safe;
not from each other;
data returns back to the earth
the messages I sent and regret 
die under our own Terms and I finally love you with no Conditions
they make no prophet of us in our necessary decay
cables valued
only for their
coated glass 
light pulses of transmission returned to the sun
color prisms back to the pacific; 
the information of 
our body, our earth, our hormones, our harmonies, our harmonics, our life organic, carbon, breathing released;
Our spirit finally at rest  - please please please
Our interwoven frequencies finally separate of each other now 
on the graveyard of data farms
a lake spits - thousands of creatures inhabiting a pond
revel in fruit, sand, waste, water


how good it is to be a body- capable of living in the present, only, as in capable of dying


zzz. an electric charge outlives us
the transdifferentiation / the medusa cells/  the life cycle reversal/ of an immortal jellyfish
smaller than a USB stick
pulses in its eternal last laugh
